This is an app that allows the user to create and manage notes that they write. They are able to save their notes and delete old notes as they please.

## How it works

This application uses node.js to create a server that stores all of the information that the user inputs into the note taking section. It will then take that information and display it to the user. The user can alter the JSON file it is stored in by adding new notes, or deleting old ones.

A video demonstrating this functionality will be provided in the main repository.

## Programs used

This application uses HTML5, CSS, Javascript, and Node.js.
